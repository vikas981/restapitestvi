Description: I needed a console friendly tool to print dates, so I made one, basing it
        on python-dateutil. Here is the output of --help:
        
        NAME
            dates - prints a list of dates
        
        SYNOPSIS
            dates [OPTIONS]
        
        OPTIONS
            --help:
                Print this help
        
            --freq <frequency>:
                Choose frequency (values admitted: YEARLY, MONTHLY, WEEKLY,
                DAILY). Defaults to DAILY.
        
            --from, --dtstart:
                Recurrence start
        
            --to, --until:
                limit of the recurrence
        
            --step, --interval:
                The interval between each freq iteration. For example, when using
                YEARLY, an interval of 2 means once every two years.
        
            --wkst:
                The week start day. Must be one of the MO, TU, WE constants, or an
                integer, specifying the first day of the week.
        
            --count:
                How many occurrences will be generated.
        
            --byweekday:
                If given, it must be either an integer (0 == MO), a sequence of
                integers, one of the weekday constants (MO, TU, etc), or a
                sequence of these constants. When given, these variables will
                define the weekdays where the recurrence will be applied.
        
            --bysetpos:
                If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
                positive or negative. Each given integer will specify an
                occurrence number, corresponding to the nth occurrence of the rule
                inside the frequency period. For example, a bysetpos of -1 if
                combined with a MONTHLY frequency, and a byweekday of (MO, TU, WE,
                TH, FR), will result in the last work day of every month. )
        
            --bymonth:
                If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
                meaning the months to apply the recurrence to.
        
            --bymonthday:
                If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
                meaning the month days to apply the recurrence to.
        
            --byyearday:
                If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
                meaning the year days to apply the recurrence to.
        
            --byweekno:
                If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
                meaning the week numbers to apply the recurrence to. Week numbers
                have the meaning described in ISO8601, that is, the first week of
                the year is that containing at least four days of the new year.
        
            --byweekday:
                If given, it must be either an integer (0 == MO) or a sequence of
                integers. When given, these variables will define the weekdays
                where the recurrence will be applied.
        
            --byeaster
                If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers,
                positive or negative. Each integer will define an offset from the
                Easter Sunday. Passing the offset 0 to byeaster will yield the
                Easter Sunday itself.
        
        EXAMPLES:
            Prints the Mondays and Tuesdays that occur every 5 days in 2010:
            dates --from 2010-01-01 --to 2011-01-01 --step 5 --byweekday '["MO","TU"]'
        
            Prints the last friday of each month of 2010:
            dates --freq MONTHLY --from 2010-01-01 --to 2011-01-01 --byweekday 'FR(-1)'
